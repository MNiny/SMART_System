# SMART System
This repository contains the auto-focusing code for the paper:
Deep-Learning Based “SMART” System for Evaluation of Tumor Spheroid Invasiveness in 3D Culture Systems

## Depence

Python 3.6.8

numpy 1.17.0

opencv_python 3.4.3

## Usage

This code provides an Application Programming Interface(API) for automatic centering, you can use auto_focus to achieve this function.
But this code depends on the functions of ccd and motor, you can implement it by yourself, or you can use our SMART system.


## Explanations
/app/cell_ball/app_script_handle.py :  auto_focus is the entry for this code

/alg/:  Related algorithm interface implementation
